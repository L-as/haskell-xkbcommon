libxkbcommon is a library by (primarily) Daniel Stone which processes keyboard events into
characters, taking into account the keyboard layout and locale settings. [1]

It is intended to, on the one hand, replace existing such functionality in the X11 project,
and on the other, provide a cleaner base for new display protocol projects such as Wayland. [2]

These are the haskell bindings of libxkbcommon.

Note that currently, haskell-xkbcommon is a very thin layer on top of libxkbcommon.

I need to read McAllister "High-level FFI in Haskell" and apply those ideas.
